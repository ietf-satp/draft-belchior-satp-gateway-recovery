 Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Gateway Crash Recovery Mechanism
              draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery-latest

Abstract

   This memo describes the crash recovery mechanism for the Secure Asset
   Transfer Protocol (SATP).  The goal of this draft is to specify the
   message flow that implements a crash recovery mechanism.  The
   mechanism assures that gateways running SATP are able to recover
   faults, enforcing ACID properties for asset transfers across ledgers
   (i.e., double spend does not occur).

1.  Introduction

   Gateway systems that perform digital asset transfers among networks
   must possess a degree of resiliency and fault tolerance in the face
   of possible crashes.  Accounting for the possibility of crashes is
   particularly important to guarantee asset consistency across
   networks.

   The crash recovering mechanism is applied to a version of SATP
   [I-D.draft-ietf-satp-core] using either 2PC or 3PC, which are atomic
   commitment protocol (ACP). 2PC and 3PC considers two roles: a
   coordinator who manages the protocol's execution and participants who
   manage the resources that must be kept consistent.  The origin
   gateway plays the ACP role of Coordinator, and the destination
   Gateway plays the Participant role in relay mode.  Gateways exchange
   messages corresponding to the protocol execution, generating log
   entries for each one.  The crash recovery draft does not depend on
   the specific SATP messages, but defines procedures to recover from
   crashes and for rollbacks, independently of the specific protocol
   phase being executed.

   Log entries are organized into logs.  Logs enable either the same or
   other backup gateways to resume any phase of SATP.  This log can also
   serve as an accountability tool in case of disputes.  Log entries are
   then the basis satisfying one of the key deployment requirements of
   gateways for asset transfers: a high degree of availability.  In this
   document, we consider two common strategies to increase availability:
   (1) to support the recovery of the gateways (self-healing model) and
   (2) to employ backup gateways with the ability to resume a stalled
   transfer (primary-backup model).

   This memo proposes:

   (i) the logging model of the crash recovery mechanism; (ii) the log
   storage types; (iii) the log storage API; (iv) the log entry format;
   (v) the recovery and rollback procedures.

2.  Terminology

   There following are some terminology used in the current document:

   *  Gateway: The collection of services which connects to a minimum of
      one network or system, and which implements the secure asset
      transfer protocol.

   *  Primary Gateway: The node of a network that has been selected or
      elected to act as a gateway in an asset transfer.

   *  Backup Gateway: The node of a network that has been selected or
      elected to act as a backup gateway to a primary gateway.

   *  Message Flow Parameters: The parameters and payload employed in a
      message flow between a sending gateway and receiving gateway.

   *  Origin Gateway: The gateway that initiates the transfer protocol.
      Acts as a coordinator of the ACP and mediates the message flow.

   *  Destination Gateway: The gateway that is the target of an asset
      transfer.  It follows instructions from the origin Gateway.

   *  Log: Set of log entries such that those are ordered by the time of
      its creation.

   *  Public (or Shared) Log: log where several gateways can read and
      write from it.

   *  Private Log: log where only one gateway can read and write from
      it.

   *  Log data: The log information is retained by a gateway connected
      to an exchanged message within an asset transfer protocol.

   *  Log entry: The log information generated and persisted by a
      gateway regarding one specific message flow step.

   *  Log format: The format of log data generated by a gateway.

   *  Atomic commit protocol (ACP): A protocol that guarantees that
      assets taken from a network are persisted into the other network.
      Examples are two and three-phase commit protocols (2PC, 3PC,
      respectively) and non-blocking atomic commit protocols.

   *  Fault: A fault is an event that alters the expected behavior of a
      system.

   *  Crash-fault tolerant models: the models allowing a system to keep
      operating correctly despite having a set of faulty components.

3.  Logging Model

   We consider the log file to be a stack of log entries.  Each time a
   log entry is added, it goes to the top of the stack (the highest
   index).  For each protocol step a gateway performs, a log entry is
   created immediately before executing and immediately after executing
   a given operation.

   To manipulate the log, we define a set of log primitives that
   translate log entry requests from a process into log entries,
   realized by the log storage API (for the context of SATP,
   Section 3.5):

   *  writeLogEntry(e,L) (WRITE) - appends a log entry e in the log L
      (held by the corresponding Log Storage Support).

   *  getLogEntry(i,L) (READ) - retrieves a log entry with index i from
      log L.

   From these primitives, other functions can be built:

   *  getLogLength (L) (READ) - obtains the number of log entries from
      log L.

   *  getLogDiff(l1,l2) (READ) - obtains the difference between two
      logs.

   *  getLastEntry(L): obtains the last log entry from log L.

   *  getLog(L): retrieves the whole log L.

   *  updateLog(l1,l2): updates l1 based on l2 (uses getLogDiff and
      writeLogEntry).

   The following example shows a simplified version log referring to the
   transfer initiation flow SATP phase.  Each log entry (simplified, see
   the definition in Section 3) is composed of metadata (phase, sequence
   number) and one attribute from the payload (operation).  Operations
   map behavior to state (see Section 4).

                               Figure 1

   This example shows the sequence of logging operations over part of
   the first phase of SATP (simplified):

   1.  At step 1, G1 writes an init-validate operation, meaning it will
       require G2 to initiate the validate function: This step generates
       a log entry (p1, 1, init-validate).

   2.  At step 2, G2 writes an exec-validate operation, meaning it will
       try to execute the validate function: This step generates a log
       entry (p1, 2, exec-validate).

   3.  At step 3, G2 writes a done-validate operation, meaning it
       successfully executed the validate function: This step generates
       a log entry (p1, 3, done-validate).

   4.  At step 4, G2 writes an ack-validate operation, meaning it will
       send an acknowledgment to G1 regarding the done-validate: This
       step generates a log entry (p1, 4, ack-validate).

   Without loss of generality, the above logging model applies to all
   phases of SATP.

3.2.  SATP Example

   This example showcases the logging procedure step 2.4 of SATP (lock-
   assertion) by both gateways.

3.3.  Log Storage Modes

   Gateways store state that is captured by logs.  Gateways have private
   logs recording enterprise-sensitive data that can be used, for
   instance, for analytics.  Entries can include end-to-end cross-
   jurisdiction transaction latency and throughput.

   Apart from the enterprise log, a state log can be public or private,
   centralized or decentralized.  This log is meant to be shared with
   everyone with an internet connection (public) or only within the
   gateway consortium (private).  Logs can be stored locally or in a
   cloud service, per gateway (centralized), or in a decentralized
   infrastructure (i.e., decentralized ledger, decentralized database).
   We call the latter option decentralized log storage.  The type of the
   state log depends on the trust assumptions among gateways and the log
   access mode.

   In greater detail:

   1.  Public decentralized log: log entries are stored on a
       decentralized public log (e.g., Ethereum blockchain, IPFS).  Each
       gateway writes non-encrypted log entries to a decentralized log
       storage.  Although this is the best option for providing
       accountability of gateways, availability, and integrity of the
       logs, leading to shorter dispute resolution, this can lead to
       leak of information which can lead to privacy issues.  The
       integrity of the log can be asserted by hashing the entries and
       comparing it to each stored hash on the decentralized log
       storage.  A solution to the privacy problems could be given by
       gateways publishing a hash of the log entry plus metadata to the
       decentralized log storage instead of the log entries.  Although
       this is a first step towards resolving privacy issues, a tradeoff
       with data availability exists.  In particular, this choice leads
       to lower availability guarantees since a gateway needs to wait
       for the counterparty gateway to deliver the logs in case logs
       need to be shared.  In this case, the decentralized log storage
       acts as a notarizing service.  This mode is recommended when
       gateways operate in the Relay Mode: Client-initiated Gateway to
       Gateway.  This mode can also be used by the Direct Mode: Client
       to Multiple Gateway access mode because gateways may need to
       share state between themselves.  Note: the difference between the
       mentioned modes is that in Direct Mode: Client to Multiple
       Gateway, a single client/organization controls all the gateways,
       whereas, in the Relay Mode, gateways are controlled by different
       organizations.

   2.  Public centralized log: log entries are published in a bulletin
       that more organizations control.  That bulletin can be updated or
       removed at any time.  Accountability is only guaranteed provided
       that there are multiple copies of such bulletin by conflicting
       parties.  Availability and integrity can be obtained via
       redundancy.

   3.  Private centralized log.  Each gateway stores logs locally or in
       a cloud in the private log storage mode but does not share them
       by default with other gateways.  If needed, logs are requested
       from the counterparty gateway.  Saving logs locally is faster
       than saving them on the respective ledger since issuing a
       transaction is several orders of magnitude slower than writing on
       a disk or accessing a cloud service.  Nonetheless, this model
       delivers weaker integrity and availability guarantees.

   4.  Private decentralized log.  Each gateway stores logs in a private
       blockchain, and are shared with other gateways by default.

   Each log storage mode provides a different process to recover the
   state from crashes.  In the private log, a gateway requires the most
   recent log from the counterparty gateway.  This mode is the one where
   the most trust is needed.  The gateway publishes hashes of log
   entries and metadata on a decentralized log storage in the
   centralized public log.  Gateways who need the logs request them from
   other gateways and perform integrity checks of the received logs.  In
   the public decentralized mode, the gateways publish the plain log
   entries on decentralized log storage.  This is the most trustless and
   decentralized mode of operation.

   By default, if there are gateways from different institutions
   involved in an asset transfer, the storage mode should be a
   decentralized log storage.  The decentralized log storage can provide
   a common source of truth to solve disputes and maintain a shared
   state, alleviating trust assumptions between gateways.

3.4.  Log Storage API

   The log storage API allows developers to be abstracted from the log
   storage support, providing a standardized way to interact with logs
   (e.g., relational vs. non-relational, local vs. on-chain).  It also
   handles access control if needed.

3.4.1.  Response Codes

   The log storage API MUST respond with return codes indicating the
   failure (error 5XX) or success of the operation (200).  The
   application may carry out a further operation in the future to
   determine the ultimate status of the operation.

   The log storage API response is in JSON format and contains two
   fields: 1) success: true if the operation was successful, and 2)
   response_data: contains the payload of the response generated by the
   log storage API.

4.  Format of Log Entries

   A gateway stores the log entries in its log, and they capture
   gateways operations.  Entries account for the current status of one
   of the three SATP flows: Transfer Initiation flow, Lock-Evidence
   flow, and Commitment Establishment flow.

   The recommended format for log entries is JSON, with protocol-
   specific mandatory fields supporting a free format field for
   plaintext or encrypted payloads directed at the SATP gateway or an
   underlying network.  Although the recommended format is JSON, other
   formats can be used (e.g., XML).

   The mandatory fields of a log entry, that SATP generates, are:

   *  Version: SATP protocol Version (major, minor).

   *  Session ID: a unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing a session.

   *  Sequence Number: monotonically increasing counter that uniquely
      represents a message from a session.

   *  SATP Phase: current SATP phase.

   *  Resource URL: Location of Resource to be accessed.

   *  Developer URN: Assertion of developer/application identity.

   *  Action/Response: GET/POST and arguments (or Response Code).

   *  Credential Profile: Specify the type of auth (e.g., SAML, OAuth,
      X.509)

   *  Credential Block: Credential token, certificate, string.

   *  Payload Profile: Asset Profile provenance and capabilities.

   *  Application Profile: Vendor or Application-specific profile.

   *  Payload: Payload for POST, responses, and native network
      transactions.  The payload is specific to the current SATP phase.

   *  Payload Hash: hash of the current message payload.

   In addition to the attributes that belong to SATP s schema, each log
   entry REQUIRES the following attributes:

   *  timestamp REQUIRED: timestamp referring to when the log entry was
      generated (UNIX format).

   *  origin_gateway_pubkey REQUIRED: the public key of the gateway
      initiating a transfer.

   *  origin_gateway_system REQUIRED: the ID of the source network.

   *  destination_gateway_pubkey REQUIRED: the public key of the gateway
      involved in a transfer.

   *  destination_gateway_system REQUIRED: the ID of the destination
      Gateway involved in a transfer.

   *  logging_profile REQUIRED: contains the profile regarding the
      logging procedure.  Default is a local store.

   *  Message_signature REQUIRED: Gateway ECDSA signature over the log
      entry.

   *  Last_entry_hash REQUIRED: Hash of previous log entry.

   *  Access_control_profile REQUIRED: the profile regarding the
      confidentiality of the log entries being stored.  Default is only
      the gateway that created the logs that can access them.

   *  Operation: the high-level operation being executed by the gateway
      on that step.  There are five types of operations: Operation init-
      states the intention of a node to execute a particular operation;
      Operation exec- expresses that the node is executing the
      operation; Operation done- states when a node successfully
      executes a step of the protocol; Operation ack- refers to when a
      node acknowledges a message received from another (e.g., the
      command executed); Operation fail- occurs when an agent fails to
      execute a specific step.

   Optional field entries are:

   *  recovery message: the type of recovery message, if the gateway is
      involved in a recovery procedure.

   *  recovery payload: the payload associated with the recovery
      message.

   Example of a log entry created by G1, corresponding to locking an
   asset (phase 2.3 of the SATP protocol):

5.  Crash Recovery Procedure

   This section defines general considerations about crash recovery for
   the self-healing mode.  Note that the procedure for the primary-
   backup mode is the same, but first has a session resumption process.

5.1.  Crash Recovery Model

   Gateways can fail by crashing (i.e., becoming silent).  In order to
   be able to recover from these crashes, gateways store log entries in
   a persistent data storage.  Thus, gateways can recover by obtaining
   the latest successful operation and continuing from there.  We
   consider two recovery models:

   1.  Self-healing mode: assumes that after a crash, a gateway
       eventually recovers.  The gateway does not lose its long-term
       keys (public-private key pair) and can reestablish all TLS
       connections.

   2.  Primary-backup mode assumes that a gateway may never recover
       after a crash but that this failure can be detected by timeout
       [AD76].  If the timeout is exceeded, a backup gateway detects
       that failure unequivocally and takes the role of the primary
       gateway.  The failure is detected using heartbeat messages and a
       conservative period.

   In both modes, after a gateway recovers, the gateways follow a
   general recovery procedure (in Section 6.2 explained in detail for
   each phase):

   1.  Crash communication: using the self-healing or primary-backup
       modes, a node recovers.  After that, it sends a message RECOVER
       to the counterparty gateways.

   2.  State update: The gateway syncs its state with the latest state,
       either by requesting it from the decentralized log storage or
       other gateways (depending on the log storage mode).  If a
       decentralized log storage is available, the crashed gateway
       attempts to update its local log, using getLogDiff from the
       shared log.  If there is no shared log, the crashed gateway needs
       to synchronize itself with the counterparty gateway by querying
       the counterparty gateway with a recovery message RECOVER
       containing the latest log before the crash.  The counterparty
       gateway sends back a RECOVER-UPDATE message with its log.  The
       recovered gateway can now reconstruct the updated log via
       getLogDiff, and derive the current state of the asset transfer.
       The gateways now share the same state and can proceed with its
       operation.

   3.  Recovery communication: The gateway and informs other gateways of
       the recovery with a recovery confirmation message is sent
       (RECOVERY-UPDATE-ACK), and the respective acknowledgment is sent
       by the counterparty gateway (RECOVERY-SUCCESS).

   Finally, the gateway resumes the normal execution of SATP (session
   resumption).

5.2.  Recovery Procedure

   The previous section explained the general procedure that gateways
   follow upon crashing.  In more detail, for each SATP phase, we define
   the recovery procedure:

5.2.1.  Transfer Initiation Flow

   This phase of SATP follows the Crash Recovery Model from Section 6.1.

5.2.2.  Lock-Evidence Flow

   This phase of SATP follows the Crash Recovery Model from Section 6.1.
   Note that, in this phase, distributed ledgers were changed by
   gateways.  The crash gateways' recovery should take place in less
   than the timeout specified for the asset transfer.  Otherwise, the
   rollback protocol present in the next section is applied.

5.2.3.  Commitment Establishment Flow

   As transactions cannot be undone on blockchains, reverting a
   transaction includes issuing new transactions (with the contrary
   effect of the ones to be reverted).  We use a rollback list to keep
   track of which transaction may be rolled back.  The crash recovery
   protocol for the Stage 2 (lock) and Stage 3 (mint) is as follows:

   1.  Rollback lists for all the gateways involved are initialized.

   2.  On step 2.1A, add a pre-lock transaction to the origin gateway
       rollback list.

   3.  On step 2.1B, if the request is denied, abort the transaction and
       apply rollbacks on the origin gateway.

   4.  On step 3.4A, add a lock transaction to the origin gateway
       rollback list.

   5.  On step 3.4B, if the commit fails, abort the transaction and
       apply rollbacks on the origin gateway.

   6.  On step 3.6A, add a create asset transaction to the rollback list
       of the destination gateway.

   7.  On step 3.8, if the commit is successful (confirmed by the ack
       final receipt), SATP terminates (3.9).

   8: Otherwise, if the last commit is unsuccessful, then abort the
   transaction and apply rollbacks to both gateways.

5.3.  Recovery Messages

   SATP-2PC messages are used to recover from crashes at the several
   SATP phases.  These messages inform gateways of the current state of
   a recovery procedure.  SATP-2PC messages follow the log format from
   Section 4.

5.3.1.  RECOVER

   A recover message is sent from the crashed gateway to the
   counterparty gateway, sending its most recent state.  This message
   type is encoded on the recovery message field of an SATP log.

   The parameters of the recovery message payload consist of the
   following:

   *  Session ID: a unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing a session.

   *  Message Type REQUIRED: urn:ietf:SATP-2pc:msgtype:recover-msg.

   *  SATP phase: latest SATP phase registered.

   *  Sequence number: latest sequence number registered.

   *  Is_Backup REQUIRED: indicates whether the sender is a backup
      gateway or not.

   *  New Identity Public Key: The public key of the sender if it is a
      backup gateway.

   *  Last_entry_timestamp REQUIRED: Timestamp of last known log entry.

   *  Sender Signature REQUIRED.  The digital signature of the sender.

5.3.2.  RECOVER-UDPDATE

   The counterparty gateway sends the recover update message after
   receiving a RECOVER message from a recovered gateway.  The recovered
   gateway informs of its current state (via the current state of the
   log).  The counterparty gateway now calculates the difference between
   the log entry corresponding to the received sequence number from the
   recovered gateway and the latest sequence number (corresponding to
   the latest log entry).  This state is sent to the recovered gateway.

   The parameters of the recover update payload consist of the
   following:

   *  Session ID: a unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing a session.

   *  Message Type REQUIRED: urn:ietf:SATP-2pc:msgtype:recover-update-
      msg.

   *  Hash Recover Message REQUIRED.  The hash of previous message.

   *  Recovered logs: the list of log messages that the recovered
      gateway needs to update.

   *  Sender Signature REQUIRED.  The digital signature of the sender.

5.3.3.  RECOVER-SUCCESS

   The recover-success message (response to RECOVER-UPDATE) states if
   the recovered gateway's logs have been successfully updated.  If
   inconsistencies are detected, the recovered gateway answers with
   initiates a dispute (RECOVER-DISPUTE message).

   The counterparty gateway sends this message to sinalize the recovered
   gateway acknowledging that the state is synchronized.

   The parameters of this message consist of the following:

   *  Session ID: a unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing a session.

   *  Message Type REQUIRED: urn:ietf:SATP-2pc:msgtype:recover-update-
      ack-msg.

   *  Hash Recover Update Message REQUIRED.  The hash of previous
      message.

   *  success: true/false.

   *  entries changed: list of hashes of log entries that were appended
      to the recovered gateway log.

   *  Sender Signature REQUIRED.  The digital signature of the sender.

5.3.4.  ROLLBACK

   A rollback message is sent by a gateway that initiates a rollback.
   The parameters of this message consist of the following:

   *  Session ID: a unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing a session.

   *  Message Type REQUIRED: urn:ietf:SATP-2pc:msgtype:rollback-msg.

   *  success: true/false.

   *  actions performed: actions performed to rollback a state (e.g.,
      UNLOCK; BURN).

   *  proofs: a list of proofs specific to the network

   *  Sender Signature REQUIRED.  The digital signature of the sender.

5.3.5.  ROLLBACK-ACK

   The counterparty gateway sends the rollback-ack message to the
   recovered gateway acknowledging that the rollback has been performed
   successfully.

   The parameters of this message consist of the following:

   *  Session ID: a unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing a session.

   *  Message Type REQUIRED: urn:ietf:SATP-2pc:msgtype:rollback-ack-msg.

   *  success: true/false.

   *  actions performed: actions performed to rollback a state (e.g.,
      UNLOCK; BURN).

   *  proofs: a list of proofs specific to the network

   *  Sender Signature REQUIRED.  The digital signature of the sender.

5.4.  Examples

   There are several situations when a crash may occur.

5.4.1.  Crashing before issuing a command to the counterparty gateway

   The following figure represents the origin gateway (G1) crashing
   before it issued an init command to the destination gateway (G2).

5.4.2.  Crashing after issuing a command to the counterparty gateway

   The second scenario requires further synchronization (figure below).
   At the retrieval of the latest log entry, G1 notices its log is
   outdated.  It updates it upon necessary validation and then
   communicates its recovery to G2.  The process then continues as
   defined.

6.  Session Resumption

   This section explains how the primary-backup mode works for crash
   recovery.  First, there is a session resumption phase.  After that,
   the gateways perform the protocol specified in Section 5.

6.1.  Gateway Replacement

   The gateway replacemenet protocol introduces an assumption.  We
   assume every gateway has a valid X.509 certificate that was issued by
   its owner, which is the entity legally responsible for the gateway.
   Moreover, in the extensions field of the certificate, there is a list
   containing the hash of the authorized backup gateways.  When the
   primary gateway crashes, a replacement is bootstrapped with the
   latest version of the local state, and it engages in a protocol with
   the counterparty gateway.  This protocol aims to establish trust
   between gateways and the creation of a new TLS session:

   1.  Validate the backup gateway certificate by running a
       certification path algorithm, which includes validating all the
       intermediate certificates up to a trusted root (can be the VASPs
       CA).

   2.  The counterparty gateway verifies if the parent certificate of
       the crashed gateway and the backup gateway is the same (proving
       they belong to the same authority).

   3.  Verify if the backup gateway certificate hash belongs to the list
       specified in the crashed gateway certificate extensions.

   The backup gateway, on its turn, defines gateways to replace it in
   case of a crash (X.509 certificate extensions).

7.  Security Considerations

   We assume a trusted, authenticated, secure, reliable communication
   channel between gateways (i.e., messages cannot be spoofed and/or
   altered by an adversary) using TLS/HTTPS [TLS].  Clients support
   acceptable credential schemes such as OAuth2.0.  We assume the
   storage service used provides the means necessary to assure the logs'
   confidentiality and integrity, stored and in transit.  The service
   must provide an authentication and authorization scheme, e.g., based
   on OAuth and OIDC [OIDC], and use secure channels based on TLS/HTTPS.
   The present protocol is crash fault-tolerant, meaning that it handles
   gateways that crash for several reasons (e.g., power outage).  The
   present protocol does not support Byzantine faults, where gateways
   can behave arbitrarily (including being malicious).  This implies
   that both gateways are considered trusted.  We assume logs are not
   tampered with or lost.

   Log entries need integrity, availability, and confidentiality
   guarantees, as they are an attractive point of attack.  Every log
   entry contains a hash of its payload for guaranteeing integrity.  If
   extra guarantees are needed (e.g., non-repudiation), a log entry
   might be signed by its creator.  Availability is guaranteed by the
   usage of the log storage API that connects a gateway to a dependable
   storage (local, external, or decentralized).  Each underlying storage
   provides different guarantees.  Access control can be enforced via
   the access control profile that each log can have associated with,
   i.e., the profile can be resolved, indicating who can access the log
   entry in which condition.  Access control profiles can be implemented
   with access control lists for simple authorization.  The
   authentication of the entities accessing the logs is done at the Log
   Storage API level (e.g., username+password authentication in local
   storage vs. decentralized access control).

   For extra guarantees, the nodes running the log storage API (or the
   gateway nodes themselves) can be protected by hardening technologies
   such as Intel SGX.

8.  Performance Considerations

   After the session setup using asymmetric-cryptography, the
   authenticated messages in the TLS Record Protocol utilize symmetric-
   key operations (using the session key).  Since symmetric-key
   operations are much faster than public-key operations, a persistent
   TLS connection delivers performance suitable for quickly exchange of
   log entries across gateways.  Upon a crash, gateways might employ
   their best effort for resuming the crashed session.

9.  Assumptions

   For the protocol to work correctly, a few assumptions are taken: i)
   the crashed gateways eventually recover, at most for a fixed time (or
   are replaced); ii) Calls to the log API do not fail.
